# 🌍 Jadoo – Travel Agency UI

A fully responsive **static travel agency UI** built by converting a **Figma design into real, production-ready code** using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.

This project focuses on **responsive layout design**, clean UI structure, and understanding how designs translate from Figma to the web across different screen sizes.

## 📱 Responsive Design

This was my **first fully responsive UI project**, and a major learning experience.

I worked through:
- Responsive breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`)
- Layout issues across different screen sizes
- Fixed width vs max-width usage
- Absolute positioning challenges
- Maintaining design consistency from Figma

Instead of relying on generators or shortcuts, the goal was to **understand how responsive UI actually works in real-world scenarios**.
